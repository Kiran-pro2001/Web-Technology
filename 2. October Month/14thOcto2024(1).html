    Semantics --- are of two types 
    1. Symentatic Tags -- header, aside, footer, article, section, nav   (6 tags)
    2. Non Symentatic Tags - div & span   (only 2 Tags)

    Semantics -- name or identifier

    Semantic Tags --- meaning is defined from the name.
    Non Semantic Tags -- meaning is not defined from the name.


    Flipkart --- non-semantic tags are used ---div is majorily used (if we open inspect we can see it)
    why not Semantic Tags ?    (ask these types of question of interview, since people can learn the tags and all)
    - Since semantic tag has a meaning, so we have to use that only. But in complex websites inside header multiple divisions are there, so for  that case if we use Semantic Tags it creates confusion, to avoid that, and get some flexibility we use non semantic tags with the customize identifier or meaning (that is done by the programmer or devleoper).
