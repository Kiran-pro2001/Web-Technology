    <!-- This is the "Major Topic of HTML" ...then we will start with CSS   

    Where we use form -- during login at amazon, signup at facebook, registration at unstop


    the purpose of any software is to interact! 

    Two Types of Web Pages - 

    1. Static Web Page - it is created once, and viewed by the users...that's it. 
    user can't change it   eg - bill board, portfolio website, wikipedia - not exactly

    2. Dynamic Web Page - user can change it
    instagram -- likes, comment, viwes...everytime it got changed. So, dynamic web page. 

    using HTML Form we can create dynamic web pages, previously we learn only static part...whatever topic we learnt till now, that was helping us  to make our website static.
    To make our website dynamic, we use HTML Form, here we can interact with the server. 

    In real world scenario, how many ways you use form - 

    name -  text
    dob -  date 
    email - email id
    phone number -  India phone number
    gender -  male, female, others  (radio buttons)
    address -   big text
    password -  ****  (hidden text)
    documents -  RC (tick)    [[ multiple choice questions ]]
              -  MC
              -  DC (tick)
    city -  dropdown  (select from them)
    upload - file to upload


    submit, reset, login (by default button -- we can customize it)

    <form action="" align="center">  <!--action is used for backend, when we want this data to be send somewhere-->
        <h1>Registration Form</h1>

        <label for="">
            Name : <input type="text">
        </label>
        <br> <br>


        <label for="">
            DOB : <input type="date">    <!--for dob, use date type of input-->
        </label>
        <br> <br>


        <label for="">
            Email : <input type="email">  <!-- to check is this email is same as text or not, use input type submit, and try to submit it, you get some popup-->
        </label>
        <br> <br>


        <label for="">
            Age : <input type="number">   <!-- input type number is used during order at amazon -- to increase the number of orders, or age increase or decrease-->
        </label>
        <br> <br>


        <label for="">
            Tele : <input type="tel" pattern="[0-9]{10}">  <!--directly tel will not work, since every country have different pattern, some have 6 characters, some have 7 with alphabets
            So , use pattern -- regular expression -- start with [] - enter the range -- from 0 to 9, and how many numbers -- use {10} -- total 10 numbers should be entered.  ...you will learn regular expression during the time of Python-- -->
        </label>
        <br> <br>


        <label for="">
            Gender : <label for="opt1">Male</label> <input type="radio" name="gender" id="opt1">
                     <label for="opt2">Female</label> <input type="radio" name="gender" id="opt2">
                     <label for="opt3">Others</label> <input type="radio" name="gender" id="opt3">
                     <!--to select only one and automatically get unselected (earlier we can't unselect it), put the same name to all the input tag-->
                     <!-- to give connection between label & input -- use for & name   -- for in label and name in input tag 
                      for & name should be same
                      Earlier we give connection between anchor tag & ifrma tag with the help of name -- so same way-->

                      <!-- now you got to know...why we can't use paragrap tag or any other tag as comparison to label tag...because label tag helps use to give connection between the input tags -->

                      <!-- ********* -->
                      <!-- same name in all the input tags 
                       for & id should be same in each label & input pairs  -->

        <label for="">
            Address : <textarea rows="5"  cols="19" ></textarea>
            <!-- we want a big space, therefore dont' use input tag, use textarea ....user can increase the size...if not, use rows & cols property -->
        </label>
        <br> <br>

        
        <label for="">
            Password : <input type="password">

        <input type="submit">
        <input type="reset">

    </form>

    <!--

    in form, the best part is...we just need to use the input and just mention the type....rest everything is same. 
    We just need to use the form type, and use input with the type ...no need to worry about anything
