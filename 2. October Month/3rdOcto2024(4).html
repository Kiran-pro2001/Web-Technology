    <!-- Concept -->

    <!-- Rowspan & Colspan is used for merging rows & columns  -->
    <!--
    firs see the picture, and then based on that....create a table...table tag, tr for table row, inside the 1st row -- how many contents you are seeing, create that much cell,
    for next row -- if that content you already created in above row, then don't make cell for that
    
    rowspan = "how many row you want to merge"
    colspan = "how many columns you want to merge"

    then put the border property, and the make it live
    now apply rowspan & colspan by seeing the picture and the result.
