    Semantics --- meaning is there...identifier 

    There are two types of Semantics -

    1. Semnatic Tags - 6 tag -- header, nav, aside, footer, article, section    [ Meaning is defined from the name]
    2. Non Semantic Tags - 2 tag --- div & span  [ Meaning is not defined from the name ]


    In Development --- Monolithic Developer   --- Handles everything.
                   --- Micro Developer  -- Handles one part of the project. 

    Suppose, you need to create a Zomato website in 1 Hours, it's next to impossible. So, you have a team of 100 members, what we do....we will devide the website into 100 components, and based on that we will share to each member. and at the end...one experienced guy will merge the final codebase. 
    This is called Monolithic Developer. (A small part will be done by each ) ---- and hence, Semantic Tags are used for this......!
