    <h1>Anchor Tag</h1>
    <!-- a tag - to link, as fish rod --hook,  ship stop -- hook  -->
    <!-- 
    a tag has two attributes - href = hyper reference -- to where refer it -- give the path to where it should refer 
     target  - that page should open in the same tab or any other tab
     it has 4 values -   _self, _blank  (remaining two we will learn during the time of iframe)
     _self is a default value 
     _blank  - make the current page blank, and open the link to the new tab 
     -->
